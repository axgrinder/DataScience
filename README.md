# DataScience
Repo for data science and visualization
This repository is for developing data science code in python. There are associated test data files that must be saved to run the code
1)  Data_Visualization is a program that takes the output .csv file from an HBM, and Agilent data acquisition unit and outputs graphs for every sensor,
    depending on type. The graphs are saved in a new or existing file on the host. The user is asked if specific graphs are required then produces
    and saves the graphs in the same folder as created/used previously
